# Simple Calculator Written in Python
Description:

This repository features a Python Calculator I created in 2023. The calculator provides a simple yet powerful command-line interface for performing basic arithmetic operations. Users can add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers by selecting the corresponding options.

Key Features:

User-Friendly Interface: The calculator offers a user-friendly interface with clear prompts for selecting the desired arithmetic operation and inputting numbers.

Four Basic Operations: Users can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division by simply entering the corresponding option. The calculator handles both integer and floating-point inputs.

Error Handling: The calculator incorporates error handling to ensure robustness. If the user provides invalid input (non-numeric values), the program prompts them to enter a valid number.

Continuous Calculation: After completing a calculation, users have the option to perform another one without restarting the program. This feature enhances user convenience and interaction.

How to Use:

Run the Python script to launch the 2023 Python Calculator.
Choose an operation by entering the corresponding number (1 for addition, 2 for subtraction, 3 for multiplication, and 4 for division).
Enter the required numbers when prompted, ensuring they are valid numeric inputs.
View the result of the calculation.
Decide whether to perform another calculation or exit the calculator.
Note: This calculator serves as a practical example of a console-based calculator application in Python, demonstrating fundamental arithmetic operations and input validation.
