# Java Tic Tac Toe Game
This repository contains a simple yet engaging implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using Java and Swing for the graphical user interface. The game features a 3x3 grid where two players take turns marking their symbols (X and O) with the goal of achieving a winning pattern.

Features:

Graphical User Interface (GUI): The game utilizes Java's Swing library to create an interactive and visually appealing user interface. The GUI includes a title bar, a 3x3 grid of buttons representing the game board, and a status label indicating the current player's turn or the game's outcome.

Randomized Start: The game starts with a random determination of which player goes first, adding an element of unpredictability to each round.

Winning Conditions: The game checks for winning conditions after each move and highlights the winning combination in green. It recognizes both "X" and "O" victories in various configurations: horizontal, vertical, and diagonal.

Tie (Cat's Game) Condition: A tie occurs when all the buttons are filled, and no player has won. The game detects a tie and appropriately communicates the result to the players.

User Interaction: Players can make their moves by clicking on the empty buttons, and the game updates the interface dynamically, displaying each move and the overall progress.

How to Play:

Run the Java program.
Enjoy a visually appealing Tic Tac Toe interface.
Click on the empty squares to make your move.
The game will notify you of the winner or declare a tie when appropriate.
Start a new game after the outcome is determined.
Note: This project serves as a simple example of Java GUI programming and basic game logic. Feel free to explore and modify the code for educational purposes or to add additional features.
